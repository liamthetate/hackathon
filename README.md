### Introduction

Hello? 
-------

Is it retro-game youâ€™re lookinâ€™ for?Â LIONOIL [name TBC] is a platform game with a 180 degree twist. Inspired by the classic platform games and [Lionel Richie's Dancing On The Ceiling ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xgT8uwDGLWk)and [TENET](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/577922-tenet).


The Game
--------

Lionel Richtea is happy living his best life. Itâ€™s party time all the time in the Richtea household. You can dance to the funk, you can even dunk if you want to. 

But wait a secondâ€¦ something isnâ€™t right, Lionel is stuck in a twisty turning time tunnel and the only way out is to keep dancing all night long. 

### UX

* Adults or children alike can play as it isn't overly complicated
* Lionel Richie fans can play as him in a fun setting and enjoy the different cultural components to the game
* Competitive side is appealed to through use of leaderboard and scores

The website will appeal to these users through:
* A quick start
* Clear instructions
* Fun theme inspired by Lionel Richie and other 80's icons
* Well-thought out UX that helps users play game

#### User Stories

* As a first time visitor, I want to be excited by the visuals and eager to start playing

##### Returning Visitor Goals

#### Design

The design of that game is inspired by the classic 8-bit platform games of the 1980s. Although much of the original framework is Mario (using Kaboom). The tone and playful tweaks have more in line with the UK 'bedroom coders' such as Codemasters using platforms for use on the Sinclair Spectrum and the Commodore 64.

The twist of the game is that the screen orientation changes which disorientates the user. The perfect hero character is 1980s singer and ceiling-dancer Lionel Richie.

Other design touchpoints are inspired by Lionel Richie's early back catalogue and the meme's of "Lionel Richtea" and Richie's massive clay head in hello.

### Features

* Jump!
  - You can jump in this game, but not any normal jumping, you can defy gravity because in Discoland nothing makes any sense!
* Rotation Rotation Rotation!
  - It might look like just a bunch of blocks on screen but no! Some of these blocks rotate the whole world and make everything way harder and more annoying! 
* Music!
  - 8-bit lionel (stolen from youtube) accompanies you on your quest, every time the world turns the pitch and speed gets higher. Soon you will grow to hate the tune as much as we did!
* Highscores!
  - See if you can get a score higher than 3, bet you canâ€™t, why? Because this game is a waste of your precious life minutes!
* Evil skulls!
  - They donâ€™t move or hurt you! Totally useless!
* You have a big fat head!
  - Collect a platinum power up and your ego will inflate, youâ€™ll jump higher AND the music slows down for dramatic effect! Sometimes the music doesnâ€™t ever speed back up either because that particular piece of code is buggy as crap (nice one Liam)!
